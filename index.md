## My Robotic Journey

My journey into robotics began when I was six years old and received a LEGO EV3 Mindstorms kit. I was immediately fascinated by how I could build various models using LEGO parts and bring them to life with the brick. As I experimented, I began modifying the parts to create different types of movements and give each build a unique purpose. This hands-on experience sparked my curiosity and laid the foundation for my interest in robotics.

When I started having robotics lesson with the LEGO EV3, I was even more intrigued on how I can use incorporate the use of sensors to control the robot I built and how the design of the robot will contribute to the stability and performance of the robot.

My first robotic competition was the IDE Series in 2022, where I took part in the Sprint Category. Although this was my first time in a robotic competition, I was surprised to see so many kids who are so passionate in robotics. I learnt to work with my team mates to achieve the best robot run. Even though we only came in 7th position, I am pleased with the result and the overall experience.

The following year, I moved on to the National Robotics Competition.
