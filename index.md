## My Robotic Journey

My journey into robotics started when I was six years old and got my first [LEGO Mindstorms EV3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_EV3) kit. I was amazed that I could build all kinds of models with LEGO pieces and bring them to life controlled by the brick.  As I played and experimented, I started changing parts to create different movements and give each robot its own special job. This hands-on fun sparked my curiosity and became the starting point of my passion for robotics.

When I started taking robotics lessons with the [LEGO SPIKE Prime](https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/spike-prime/troubleshooting/spike-prime-faqs/#:~:text=™%20Prime%20FAQs-,General,to%20becoming%20resilient%2C%20independent%20thinkers) (successor of LEGO Mindstorms EV3), I became even more excited about how sensors could be used to control the robots I built. I also learned how important the design is for making the robot more stable and work better. These lessons made me even more curious and helped grow my love for robotics.

My first robotics competition was the [IDE Series](https://ideseries.org/#intro) in 2022, where I took part in the Robotics Category. It was an eye-opening experience and I was amazed to see so many students who shared the same passion for robotics. During the competition, I learned how important teamwork is, as my teammates and I worked closely together to get the best robot run we could. Even though we finished in 7th place, I’m really proud of what we achieved and thankful for everything I learned from the experience.

In 2023, I took part in the [National Robotics Competition (NRC)](https://www.science.edu.sg/for-schools/competitions/national-robotics-competition), where I was introduced to more detailed task requirements, a larger playing field, and the need to present our learning journey. It was a more demanding competition and required a longer preparation time. My team and I worked closely together, constantly making adjustments to both our robot and our presentation.

We felt confident on the day of the competition, but unfortunately, our robot didn’t perform as well as it had during practice, possibly due to dust that had built up on the playing field. Although we didn’t make it to the final round, we were thrilled to be awarded 3rd place for Best Presentation and Best Programming. We learned a lot from this experience and promised ourselves we would return in 2024.

For NRC 2024, the theme was water conservation, and we started preparing early. We made great progress with both our robot and our presentation. We also spent more time researching how to conserve water and learned many ways to help protect this precious resource. Using what we learned from 2023, we improved the robot’s stability and traction, which helped us perform well and reach the final round.

Unfortunately, during the final run, a piece of LEGO got stuck under the robot, stopping it from completing the task. While we were disappointed, we understood that unexpected issues can happen and that the best way forward is to learn from them. Despite the setback, we were proud to be awarded 3rd place once again for our Learning Journey presentation.

## My Coding Journey

### Arduino

I began my journey into coding with the Arduino [Elegoo Uno R3 Starter Kit](https://www.elegoo.com/blogs/arduino-projects/elegoo-uno-r3-project-the-most-complete-starter-kit-tutorial). This kit gave me the chance to mix coding with electronics, which made learning really fun and exciting. I was able to build cool projects with lights, sensors, and more. That got me super interested, so I started taking Arduino lessons, and soon, I was making things I never thought I could!

Here are some of the projects I have done:

<!--
Armed with the knowledge from Arduino, I built a recycling bin using recycled materials, and Arduino to control a series of flaps powered by Servo Motors, so that the recycling bin is sort and direct materials for recycling to the respective bins with the touch of a button. Each button corresponds to a type of recycable material and is labeled using braille. There is even an Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) to show users what buttons they have pressed and the status of the bins. Additionally, a buzzer helps to tell the visually impaired on what button they have pressed (with the sound of a series of beeps). If the bin is full, a low beep will be sounded.

Armed with what I learnt from Arduino, I built a smart recycling bin for the visually impaired using recycled materials and electronic components. The bin uses Servo Motors to control a set of flaps that sort and direct items into the correct bins with just the press of a button. Each button is labeled in braille, so it’s accessible to visually impaired users.

I also added a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) to show what button was pressed and the current status of the bins. To make it even more user-friendly, I included a buzzer that plays different beep patterns: one to confirm the button press and another low beep to alert when a bin is full. This project helped me understand how coding and electronics can work together to solve real-world problems!

This project was submitted to Tan Kah Kee Young Inventor's Award Competition (TKKYIA). Unfortunately, it was not selected for the interview round. Though I was a bit disappointed, I told myself to look at the bright side of things and try to test the recycling bin with visually-impaired users and this may allow them to recycle with ease.

### Python

I first self-learnt Python from two books

I then started coding lessons for Python to broaden by Python coding knowledge.
