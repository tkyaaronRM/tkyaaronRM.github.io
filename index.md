My journey into robotics started when I was six years old and got my first [LEGO Mindstorms EV3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_EV3) kit. I was amazed that I could build all kinds of models with LEGO pieces and bring them to life controlled by the brick.  As I played and experimented, I started changing parts to create different movements and give each robot its own special job. This hands-on fun sparked my curiosity and became the starting point of my passion for robotics.

When I started taking robotics lessons with the [LEGO SPIKE Prime](https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/spike-prime/troubleshooting/spike-prime-faqs/#:~:text=™%20Prime%20FAQs-,General,to%20becoming%20resilient%2C%20independent%20thinkers) (successor of LEGO Mindstorms EV3), I became even more excited about how sensors could be used to control the robots I built. I also learned how important the design is for making the robot more stable and work better. These lessons made me even more curious and helped grow my love for robotics.

My first robotics competition was the [IDE Series](https://ideseries.org/#intro) in 2022, where I took part in the Robotics Category. It was an eye-opening experience and I was amazed to see so many students who shared the same passion for robotics. During the competition, I learned how important teamwork is, as my teammates and I worked closely together to get the best robot run we could. Even though we finished in 7th place, I’m really proud of what we achieved and thankful for everything I learned from the experience.

In 2023, I took part in the [National Robotics Competition (NRC)](https://www.science.edu.sg/for-schools/competitions/national-robotics-competition), where I was introduced to more detailed task requirements, a larger playing field, and the need to present our learning journey. It was a more demanding competition and required a longer preparation time. My team and I worked closely together, constantly making adjustments to both our robot and our presentation.

We felt confident on the day of the competition, but unfortunately, our robot didn’t perform as well as it had during practice, possibly due to dust that had built up on the playing field. Although we didn’t make it to the final round, we were thrilled to be awarded 3rd place for Best Presentation and Best Programming. We learned a lot from this experience and promised ourselves we would return in 2024.

For NRC 2024, the theme was water conservation, and we started preparing early. We made great progress with both our robot and our presentation. We also spent more time researching how to conserve water and learned many ways to help protect this precious resource. Using what we learned from 2023, we improved the robot’s stability and traction, which helped us perform well and reach the final round.

Unfortunately, during the final run, a piece of LEGO got stuck under the robot, stopping it from completing the task. While we were disappointed, we understood that unexpected issues can happen and that the best way forward is to learn from them. Despite the setback, we were proud to be awarded 3rd place once again for our Learning Journey presentation.

## My Coding Journey

### C++ with Arduino

I began my journey into coding with C++ through the Arduino [Elegoo Uno R3 Starter Kit](https://www.elegoo.com/blogs/arduino-projects/elegoo-uno-r3-project-the-most-complete-starter-kit-tutorial). This kit gave me the chance to mix coding with electronics, which made learning really fun and exciting. I was able to build cool projects with lights, sensors, and more. That got me super interested, so I started taking Arduino lessons, and soon, I was making things I never thought I could!

Here are some of the projects I have done:

<!--
Armed with the knowledge from Arduino, I built a recycling bin using recycled materials, and Arduino to control a series of flaps powered by Servo Motors, so that the recycling bin is sort and direct materials for recycling to the respective bins with the touch of a button. Each button corresponds to a type of recycable material and is labeled using braille. There is even an Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) to show users what buttons they have pressed and the status of the bins. Additionally, a buzzer helps to tell the visually impaired on what button they have pressed (with the sound of a series of beeps). If the bin is full, a low beep will be sounded.

Armed with what I learnt from Arduino, I built a smart recycling bin for the visually impaired using recycled materials and electronic components. The bin uses Servo Motors to control a set of flaps that sort and direct items into the correct bins with just the press of a button. Each button is labeled in braille, so it’s accessible to visually impaired users.

I also added a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) to show what button was pressed and the current status of the bins. To make it even more user-friendly, I included a buzzer that plays different beep patterns: one to confirm the button press and another low beep to alert when a bin is full. This project helped me understand how coding and electronics can work together to solve real-world problems!

This project was submitted to Tan Kah Kee Young Inventor's Award Competition (TKKYIA). Unfortunately, it was not selected for the interview round. Though I was a bit disappointed, I told myself to look at the bright side of things and try to test the recycling bin with visually-impaired users and this may allow them to recycle with ease.

### Python

Form the begining of my coding in C++, I soon ventured into Python. Driven by curiosity, I started teaching myself Python by reading books. As I learned more, I realized how much I could achieve with Python, from building apps to automating tasks. To deepen my understanding, I attended Python coding lessons and expanded my skills. Python opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me!

Here are some of my Coding Projects:

🎲 Magic 8-Ball: 
A fun Python script that simulates the classic Magic 8-Ball toy, providing random answers to your yes-or-no questions

🧮 BMI Calculator:
An application that calculates Body Mass Index based on user input, helping understand health metrics through code.

☕ Caffeine Tracker:
A program designed to monitor daily caffeine intake, combining health awareness with programming practice.

🔢 Math Quiz Series:
A set of Python scripts generating random math quizzes, enhancing both my math skills and coding logic.

🛒 Shopping App:
A simple application that simulates a shopping experience, introducing concepts of item selection and budgeting.

🎮 Python RPG:
An early attempt at creating a text-based role-playing game, exploring storytelling and user interaction through code.

🏫 School Database:
A project aimed at managing student records, grades, and attendance, delving into data handling and storage.

🚗 Robot Car Design:
A conceptual design document for a robot car, merging interests in robotics and programming.

📱 WhatsApp Clone:
An endeavor to recreate basic messaging functionalities, understanding communication protocols and user interfaces.

## My Music Journey

### Musical Beginings

My musical path began at the tender age of five, when I first laid my hands on the piano. Just a year later, I picked up the violin—and quickly developed a deep passion for both instruments. This early introduction to music laid the foundation for what has become a meaningful and exciting journey of musical growth.

### Achievements and Recognition

By the age of nine, I achieved the prestigious ABRSM Grade 8 Merit in Violin, followed by a Grade 8 Distinction in Piano at just ten. These accomplishments paved the way for my active involvement in music competitions and earned me a place in my school’s String Ensemble. 

I started joining music competitions when I was really young, and one of my earliest achievements was winning a Gold Award at the Asia Music Festival when I was just six. At eight, I took part in the Mandeville Music Awards and won Gold Awards for both Violin and Piano, plus a special Double Commendation Award.

In 2024, I was proud to receive Gold Awards at both the Singapore Raffles Music Festival and the SMTA Performers' Festival & Chamber Music Competition. I’ve also had the chance to take part in some international competitions. In 2024, I won First Prize in the International Music Competition Oxford “Grand Prize Virtuoso” (Junior Category), and in 2025, I received First Prize in the American Protégé International Piano & Strings Competition. I was also awarded Second Prize in The New York Classical Music Competition for Violin (Young Performers II category), and no First Prize was given in that category that year.

### Highlights of Performances
I love performing with like-minded friends and have taken part in many public recitals, sharing my music with different audiences. One of my most memorable performances was at the Bach in the Subway event, where I played a piano solo and also performed the Bach Double Concerto with a mini-ensemble.

Recently, I started exploring chamber music and had my first public performance in January 2025, where I played the first movement of the Borodin String Quartet. It was a wonderful experience, and I was fascinated by how four different instruments, each playing its own part, could come together to create such beautiful, harmonious music.

I’m also currently working with Alexandra Hospital to organise a performance in July 2025 for the staff and patients. The program will include a mix of solo and chamber pieces, featuring both classical works and some familiar, well-loved tunes.

### String Ensemble

I was first accepted into the NYPS String Ensemble through an audition when I was in Primary One (2020). However, due to COVID-19, all activities for lower primary students were put on hold. I rejoined in Primary Three (2022), this time as part of the Senior String Ensemble in the First Violin section. That same year, we performed at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation.

Being part of the String Ensemble taught me how to play as a team, not just as a soloist. I learned the importance of listening carefully, coordinating with my teammates, and following the conductor. In 2024, I performed at the SYF Arts Presentation again, and we were proud to achieve a Certificate of Distinction for our performance.

In 2024, I was given the role of Assistant CCA Leader of the String Ensemble, and in 2025, I was honoured to become the CCA Leader and Concertmaster. I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve in a leadership position in the music domain. Through this role, I’ve learned how to guide my teammates, support them, and encourage everyone to give their very best.

### Future Aspirations

I would like to continue playing music with an ensemble or orchestra, and to keep exploring new boundaries through chamber music. More importantly, I hope to share my music and bring joy to the community—especially to patients who are confined in hospitals due to illness. Through the power of live music and its ability to lift the spirit, I hope to support and enhance the healing process in a meaningful way.
